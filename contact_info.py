        This application is designed to facilitate accessing two types of datasets:

        **Ecological & Biological Data**: Most of these datasets are from the book: *Biostatistical Design and Analysis Using R: A Practical Guide* by Murray Logan (2010), Wiley-Blackwell. ISBN: 978-1-405-19008-4. These datasets cover various ecological studies including beetle populations, ant biomass, rodent species, and more.

            - Water resources and their use
            - Agricultural water management
            - Water and food security
            - Environmental sustainability
